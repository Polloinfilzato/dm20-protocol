"""
Role-based permission system for multi-player campaigns.

This module implements an opt-in permission layer for MCP tool calls.
When no player_id is provided, the system operates in single-player DM mode
with full access and zero overhead. When player_id is present, permissions
are checked against the caller's role and entity ownership.

Key components:
- PlayerRole: Enum for DM, PLAYER, OBSERVER roles
- PermissionLevel: Enum for ALLOWED, DENIED, CONDITIONAL access
- PERMISSION_MATRIX: Dict mapping (role, tool_name) to permission levels
- PermissionResolver: Validates MCP tool calls against caller role and ownership
