"""
Web server for Party Mode player UI.

Runs a Starlette/Uvicorn server in a background thread with its own asyncio
event loop. The server MUST NOT block the main thread (which runs the MCP
stdio transport).

Key components:
- Starlette app with routes for player UI and WebSocket connections
- Background thread lifecycle management (start/stop)
- WebSocket connection manager for real-time updates
- Token-based authentication middleware
- Integration with PCRegistry, PermissionResolver, and StorageManager

Routes:
- GET /play?token=xxx - Serve player UI (static HTML)
- POST /action - Submit player action
- GET /character/{player_id} - Get character data (with permission check)
- GET /status - Server health and connected players
- WS /ws?token=xxx - WebSocket connection for real-time updates
