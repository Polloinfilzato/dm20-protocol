Adventurers, the forsaken, and seekers of truth converge upon this desolate land, drawn by myths of hidden treasures, ancient powers, and the promise of redemption\u2014or damnation. Your roads cross at the Grey Mere tavern, where the line between destiny and chance blurs into darkness, and every choice pulls you deeper into the mysteries that Shadowfen jealously guards.",
