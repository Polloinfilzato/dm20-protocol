# Issue #178: Party Mode — per-device audio mute toggle

## Summary

Add a per-device mute toggle to the Party Mode player UI, persisted in `localStorage`.

## Files Changed

- `src/dm20_protocol/party/static/index.html` — added `<button class="mute-btn" id="mute-btn">`
- `src/dm20_protocol/party/static/app.js` — `audioMuted` state, guard in `handleAudioChunk()`, event listener
- `src/dm20_protocol/party/static/style.css` — `.mute-btn` styles

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Mute button visible in the player UI (header top-right)
- [x] State persisted in `localStorage` (survives page reload)
- [x] Muting one client does not affect other clients
- [x] Default is unmuted (no regression for existing users)
