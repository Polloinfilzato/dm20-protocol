# Task: Core Terms Dictionary — ~500 Curated IT/EN Term Pairs

## Description

Create the curated YAML dictionary file `core_terms.yaml` containing approximately 500 Italian ↔ English D&D term pairs across all major categories. This is the static foundation of the terminology system — terms that are always available regardless of which rulebooks are loaded.

The dictionary should include common colloquial variants (e.g., "PdF" for "Palla di Fuoco") and mixed-language patterns Italian players actually use.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File created at `src/dm20_protocol/terminology/data/core_terms.yaml`
- [ ] At least 498 term entries (target ~500)
- [ ] All 11 categories covered with minimum counts:
  - Skills: 18 entries
  - Abilities: 6 entries
  - Conditions: 15 entries
  - Combat terms: 30 entries
  - Spell schools: 8 entries
  - Core spells: 100 entries
  - Core monsters: 100 entries
  - Classes: 12 entries
  - Races: 9 entries
  - Items: 20 entries
  - General D&D terms: 180+ entries
- [ ] Each entry has: canonical, category, en, it_primary, it_variants (at least 1 variant per entry)
- [ ] Colloquial abbreviations included where common (e.g., TS for Tiro Salvezza, CA for Classe Armatura)
- [ ] YAML is valid and parseable
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout file
- [ ] Italian translations are accurate per official D&D 5e Italian translations where available
