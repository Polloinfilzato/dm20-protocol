# Task: Starter Adventure Content

## Description
Create a built-in "tutorial dungeon" — a small, self-contained starter adventure that serves as the default content for the onboarding flow. Includes 1 location with atmospheric description, 2 NPCs with distinct personalities, and 1 encounter that teaches basic gameplay mechanics (exploration, dialogue, and combat).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 1 detailed location: atmospheric description, points of interest, exits/connections
- [ ] 2 NPCs with distinct personalities, dialogue hooks, and knowledge about the location
- [ ] 1 encounter: can be triggered by exploration or NPC interaction, includes combat or skill challenge
- [ ] Content is stored as game state data (created via dm20-protocol tools, not raw JSON)
- [ ] Onboarding flow (#119) uses this content as the default first scene
- [ ] Content works with all model profiles
- [ ] Adventure demonstrates core gameplay: exploration → NPC dialogue → encounter resolution

## Technical Details
- Create content using existing tools: `create_location`, `create_npc`, game state setup
- Location: A crossroads tavern or similar universal D&D starting point
  - Rich description with sensory details (sounds, smells, lighting)
  - 2-3 interactive elements (notice board, mysterious item, hidden passage)
- NPC 1: Tavern keeper / quest giver — friendly, exposition-delivery voice
- NPC 2: Mysterious traveler / combat trigger — cryptic, hints at danger
- Encounter: Goblin ambush or bar fight — simple enough for tutorial, exciting enough to hook
- Store as a "starter module" that gets loaded during onboarding
- Content format: JSON files in `data/starter_adventure/` or created programmatically

## Dependencies
- [ ] #119 — Onboarding flow (provides the framework where this content is used)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: true (content creation, no shared infrastructure files)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Location created with full description
- [ ] 2 NPCs created with personalities and dialogue
- [ ] Encounter designed and implementable
- [ ] Content tested through onboarding flow
- [ ] Works across all model profiles
