# Epic: System Evolution

## Overview

Major architectural enhancements to dm20-protocol that extend its core capabilities. These are larger features discovered during the Game Loop Playtest that require dedicated design and implementation effort.

## Tasks

- [x] #74 - Character Model v2 & Creation Wizard (L/XL) — Complete character sheet model + guided creation
- [ ] #75 - Dual-Agent Response Architecture (L) — Fast narrator + slow arbiter for responsive gameplay

## Estimated Effort

| Task | Size | Hours |
|------|------|-------|
| #74 Character Model v2 & Creation Wizard | L/XL | 16-24 |
| #75 Dual-Agent Response Architecture | L | 12-16 |
| **Total** | **XL** | **28-40** |

These tasks are independent and can run in parallel, but each is large enough to warrant its own dedicated focus.

## Notes

Both features may eventually need their own PRDs when work begins, given their size and architectural impact. This epic serves as a tracking container until then.
