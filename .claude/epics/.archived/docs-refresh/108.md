# Task: PLAYER_GUIDE.md — Full Rewrite

## Description

Rewrite PLAYER_GUIDE.md as a comprehensive guide for solo D&D play with the AI DM. The current version (266 lines) covers basic commands but misses character builder, multi-source rulebooks, rest mechanics, level-up, and bilingual support.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Covers complete gameplay lifecycle: setup → create → play → combat → rest → level-up → save
- [ ] Explains rulebook loading with examples (SRD, Open5e, 5etools)
- [ ] Explains character creation with all 3 ability methods (Manual, Standard Array, Point Buy)
- [ ] Explains level-up process
- [ ] Explains rest mechanics (long rest, short rest, hit dice, spell slots)
- [ ] Explains death saves
- [ ] Mentions bilingual support for Italian players
- [ ] Includes "What the AI DM does for you" section (dual-agent benefit)
- [ ] Includes troubleshooting / FAQ section
- [ ] Written in clear, approachable English
