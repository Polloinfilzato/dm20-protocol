# Task: ROADMAP.md + DEVELOPMENT.md Updates

## Description

Update ROADMAP.md to reflect current completion status and add future direction. Update DEVELOPMENT.md to reflect current architecture with 50+ tools, Character v2 model, and new subsystems.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ROADMAP.md
- [ ] All completed items marked as "Done" with brief description
- [ ] Phase 1 (DM Persona & Game Loop) marked fully complete
- [ ] New completed milestones added: multi-source rulebook, character v2, bilingual resolver, dual-agent architecture
- [ ] Phase 2+ items updated (some are done: spell slot tracking, etc.)
- [ ] Future direction section added with realistic next steps
- [ ] "Last updated" date corrected
- [ ] Architecture Notes section still accurate

### DEVELOPMENT.md
- [ ] Tool count updated from "25+" to actual count
- [ ] Project structure reflects current directory layout
- [ ] Data models section includes Character v2 fields (experience_points, speed, conditions, tool_proficiencies, hit_dice_type, Feature model)
- [ ] New subsystems mentioned: terminology/, claudmaster/agents/, library/
- [ ] Architecture overview mentions multi-source rulebooks, dual-agent, bilingual

## Technical Details

### ROADMAP.md future direction ideas

- PyPI distribution (uvx dm20-protocol)
- Module playtesting with real published adventures
- Narrative quality tuning (style calibration)
- Session transcript export
- Campaign import from VTT formats (Foundry, Roll20)
- Performance profiling under heavy use

### DEVELOPMENT.md sections to update

1. Project Structure — add new directories (terminology/, claudmaster/agents/, library/)
2. Tool Categories — update count and list
3. Data Models — add Character v2 fields, Feature model, TermEntry model
4. Architecture — mention dual-agent, multi-source, bilingual subsystems

### Source files to reference

- `src/dm20_protocol/` directory structure
- `src/dm20_protocol/models.py` — Character v2 fields
- `src/dm20_protocol/mcp/main.py` — tool count
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — current content to update
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` — current content to update

## Dependencies

- [ ] No task dependencies

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: true
- Conflicts: none
