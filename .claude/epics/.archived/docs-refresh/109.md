# Task: docs/GUIDE.md — Updated Tools Reference

## Description

Update the User Guide with a complete tools reference covering all 50+ MCP tools, organized by feature area with practical workflow examples. Style: panoramic overview + examples (not exhaustive API docs).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All MCP tools listed and organized by category
- [ ] Each category has a brief description + 1-2 practical examples
- [ ] Tool count matches actual count from source code
- [ ] New tool categories added: Character Builder, Level-Up, Rest, Multi-Source Rulebooks, Bilingual
- [ ] Workflow examples: character creation flow, combat flow, session flow
- [ ] System prompt recommendation updated if needed
- [ ] No broken internal links

## Technical Details

### Tools to add/verify (grouped by category)

**Rulebook Management:**
- load_rulebook, list_rulebooks, unload_rulebook
- search_rules, get_class_info, get_race_info, get_spell_info, get_monster_info
- validate_character_rules

**Character Builder & Progression:**
- create_character (enhanced with ability_method, subclass, subrace, background)
- level_up_character
- use_spell_slot, add_spell, remove_spell
- long_rest, short_rest
- add_death_save
- equip_item, unequip_item, remove_item

**PDF Library:**
- open_library_folder, scan_library, list_library

**Existing tools (verify still documented):**

### Workflow examples to include

1. **Character creation with rulebook** — load SRD → create character with standard array → verify
2. **Solo play session** — configure DM → start session → player actions → save
3. **Combat encounter** — start combat → turns → damage → end → XP

### Source for tool verification

Read `src/dm20_protocol/mcp/main.py` and `src/dm20_protocol/mcp/tools/` to get exact tool names and parameters.
