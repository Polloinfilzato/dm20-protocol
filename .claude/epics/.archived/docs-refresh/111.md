# Task: Cross-File Consistency Review

## Description

Final review pass across all 6 updated documentation files to ensure consistency in tool names, feature descriptions, counts, and working internal links.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tool count is the same across README, GUIDE, DEVELOPMENT (exact number from source)
- [ ] Feature names are consistent (e.g., always "Multi-Source Rulebook" not sometimes "Multi-Source Rules")
- [ ] All internal markdown links work (`[text](path)` and `#anchor` links)
- [ ] No references to outdated info (old tool names, removed features, wrong paths)
- [ ] README links to PLAYER_GUIDE, GUIDE, ROADMAP, DEVELOPMENT, CHANGELOG all resolve
- [ ] PLAYER_GUIDE links back to README and GUIDE where appropriate
- [ ] No TODO/placeholder text left in any file

## Technical Details

### Cross-reference checklist

| Item | Files that mention it |
|------|----------------------|
| Total tool count | README, GUIDE, DEVELOPMENT |
| Slash commands list | README, PLAYER_GUIDE |
| Character builder capabilities | README, PLAYER_GUIDE, GUIDE |
| Multi-source rulebook list | README, PLAYER_GUIDE, GUIDE, CHANGELOG |
| Dual-agent architecture | README, PLAYER_GUIDE, ROADMAP |
| Bilingual support | README, PLAYER_GUIDE, CHANGELOG |

### Link verification

Check all `[text](path)` and `[text](#anchor)` links in:
- README.md
- PLAYER_GUIDE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- docs/GUIDE.md
- docs/ROADMAP.md
- docs/DEVELOPMENT.md

## Dependencies

- [ ] Depends on: #106, #107, #108, #109, #110 (all other docs tasks must be complete first)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: false (depends on all other tasks)
- Conflicts: none
