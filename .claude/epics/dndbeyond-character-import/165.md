# Task: Documentation update

## Description

Update README.md, GUIDE.md, and CHANGELOG.md to document the new D&D Beyond character import feature. Include usage examples, supported URL formats, file import instructions, and troubleshooting for common errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] README.md mentions D&D Beyond import as a feature
- [ ] GUIDE.md has a dedicated section for character import with examples
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated under `[Unreleased]` with the new feature
- [ ] Instructions for setting a DDB character to Public are included
- [ ] Instructions for saving DDB JSON from browser dev tools are included
- [ ] Troubleshooting section covers: private character, not found, endpoint down

## Technical Details

### README.md additions

Add to features list:
- "Import characters from D&D Beyond (URL or JSON file)"

### GUIDE.md additions

New section: **Importing Characters from D&D Beyond**

Contents:
1. **Quick import from URL** — example with `import_from_dndbeyond`
2. **Making your character public** — DDB settings path: Character Sheet → Settings → Character Privacy → Public
3. **File import fallback** — how to save JSON from browser dev tools (Network tab → filter "character" → copy response)
4. **What gets imported** — list of mapped fields
5. **What doesn't get imported** — known limitations (homebrew content, custom items without full stats)
6. **Troubleshooting** — error messages and solutions

### CHANGELOG.md additions

Under `[Unreleased]`:
```markdown
### Added
- D&D Beyond character import via URL or local JSON file
- New MCP tools: `import_from_dndbeyond`, `import_character_file`
- DDB-to-dm20 character mapping for identity, stats, inventory, spells, features
```

## Dependencies

- [ ] #163 — MCP tools must be finalized to document correct usage

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: true (can run alongside #164 after #163 is done)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] README.md updated with feature mention
- [ ] GUIDE.md has complete import section with examples
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] All documentation reviewed for accuracy against actual implementation
