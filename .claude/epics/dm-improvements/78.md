# Task: Add /dm:help Command for DM Commands Overview

## Summary

Create a `/dm:help` command that provides a quick overview of all available `/dm` commands with brief explanations. Follows the existing `/pm:help` pattern.

## Files Involved

```
.claude/commands/dm/
├── action.md      (existing)
├── combat.md      (existing)
├── save.md        (existing)
├── start.md       (existing)
└── help.md        (TO CREATE)
```

**Reference:** `.claude/commands/pm/help.md` and `.claude/scripts/pm/help.sh`

## Recommended Approach

**Script bash** (like `/pm:help`): the script dynamically reads `.md` files in `.claude/commands/dm/` and extracts descriptions from frontmatter.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/dm:help` is recognized as a valid command
- [ ] Output shows all available `/dm:*` commands (start, action, combat, save, help)
- [ ] Each command has a brief description (1-2 lines) of its purpose
- [ ] Output is clearly formatted and readable
- [ ] Command works without arguments (shows everything)
- [ ] (Optional) Command accepts argument for details on a single command: `/dm:help start`

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 1-2
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `.claude/commands/dm/help.md` created
- [ ] Optional: `.claude/scripts/dm/help.sh` created
- [ ] Command shows all DM commands with descriptions
- [ ] Tested and working
