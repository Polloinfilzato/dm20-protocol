# Epic: DM Gameplay Improvements

## Overview

A collection of targeted improvements to the DM gameplay experience discovered during the Game Loop Playtest (Issue #73). These are small-to-medium fixes and enhancements that improve the player-facing quality of DM sessions.

## Tasks

- [ ] #76 - Dice Roll Context Labels (S) — Add `label` parameter to `roll_dice` for context
- [ ] #77 - Fix /dm:action and /dm:combat slash command invocation (S-M) — Fix broken mid-session commands
- [ ] #78 - Add /dm:help command (S) — Create help overview for all `/dm` commands

## Estimated Effort

| Task | Size | Hours |
|------|------|-------|
| #76 Dice Roll Context Labels | S | 1-2 |
| #77 Fix /dm:action and /dm:combat | S-M | 2-3 |
| #78 Add /dm:help command | S | 1-2 |
| **Total** | **S-M** | **4-7** |

All tasks are independent and can run in parallel.
