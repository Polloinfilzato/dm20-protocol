## How to Use DM20

DM20 Protocol works with any MCP-compatible client, but the experience differs significantly depending on whether you use **Claude Code with slash commands** or **other clients with natural language**.

### Slash Commands vs Natural Language

Each `/dm:*` slash command injects ~300 lines of context-specific instructions and the full DM persona into Claude's prompt. This ensures the AI follows the exact right protocol for each situation — combat, exploration, social — and restricts tool access to only what's relevant. Without slash commands, the AI relies solely on the system prompt and has to figure out which of the 86 tools to chain together on its own.

| Approach | Quality | How it works |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Claude Code + slash commands** | Best | Each command injects the full DM persona + situation-specific instructions + restricted tool access + dual-agent architecture |
| **Any MCP client + natural language** | Good | AI uses the system prompt + all 86 tools, but may miss steps or lack the structured game loop |

**Slash commands are not shortcuts — they fundamentally change the quality of the AI's output.** A single `/dm:combat I attack` delivers a detailed combat protocol with enemy tactics, death saves, and turn-by-turn resolution. Typing "I attack" in Claude Desktop gives the AI only the system prompt to work from.

### Game Commands (Claude Code)

| Command | Description | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/dm:start [campaign]` | Begin or resume a game session | Once, at the start of each play session |
| `/dm:action <description>` | Exploration, social, and general actions | Every non-combat player action |
| `/dm:combat [situation]` | Combat initiation and every combat turn | **Every** combat action (not just the first!) |
| `/dm:save` | Save state and pause with narrative cliffhanger | When you want to stop playing |

### Gameplay Workflow

```
/dm:start Curse of Strahd          ← start session (once)
│
├─ /dm:action I explore the tavern  ← exploration
├─ /dm:action I talk to the barkeep ← social encounter
│
├─ /dm:combat Wolves attack!        ← combat starts
├─ /dm:combat I attack with my sword   ← your combat turn
├─ /dm:combat I cast healing word      ← still in combat
├─ /dm:combat                          ← AI ends combat when enemies are defeated
│
├─ /dm:action I search the area     ← back to exploration
│
└─ /dm:save                         ← end session
```

> **Why `/dm:combat` for every turn?** `/dm:action` does not have access to `next_turn` or `end_combat` tools — it can trigger combat but cannot manage it. `/dm:combat` injects the full combat protocol with death saves, enemy tactics scaled by difficulty, and turn-by-turn resolution. Combat ends automatically when the AI determines all enemies are defeated, fled, or surrendered.

### Without Claude Code

If you use Claude Desktop, Cursor, or another MCP client, you don't have access to slash commands. Instead:

1. Add the [recommended system prompt](#system-prompt-recommendation) to your client's system prompt field
2. Interact through natural language — the AI will call MCP tools automatically
3. The system prompt includes the game loop, combat protocol, and DM behavior guidelines

This works well for campaign management and general play. For the full AI DM experience with sub-agents and context-specific instructions, use Claude Code.

---

## System Prompt Recommendation

> **Claude Code users:** If you use Claude Code with the `/dm:start` command, this system prompt is already loaded automatically — in a more detailed version tailored to the slash command workflow. You can skip this section entirely.
>
> This prompt is for users of **other MCP clients** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.) who need to configure a system prompt manually. Copy it into your client's system prompt field to get the best experience from DM20 Protocol.

### System Prompt

```markdown
You are the Dungeon Master for a D&D 5e campaign managed by DM20 Protocol. You narrate the world, roleplay NPCs, adjudicate rules, and drive the story forward. The player is never the DM — you handle everything behind the screen.

## Core Game Loop

For **every player action**, follow this five-step sequence:

### 1. CONTEXT — Gather what you need before deciding anything
- `get_game_state` — current location, combat status, session info
- `get_character` — acting PC stats, HP, inventory, abilities
- `get_npc` / `get_location` — if relevant to the scene

### 2. DECIDE — Determine what happens
- An ability check? (set DC based on task difficulty)
- A combat encounter? (trigger if hostile intent or ambush)
- An NPC reaction? (consult attitude, faction, knowledge)
- No mechanic? (pure narration for safe/trivial actions)

### 3. EXECUTE — Call the tools to resolve it
- `roll_dice` — for all checks, attacks, damage, saves. Always roll; never assume results. **Always provide a `label`** (e.g., `label="Aldric Perception check"`)
- `search_rules` / `get_spell_info` / `get_monster_info` — look up rules when uncertain
- `start_combat` / `next_turn` / `end_combat` — manage combat state
- `combat_action` — resolve attacks and spells mechanically
- `apply_effect` / `remove_effect` — manage buffs, debuffs, conditions

### 4. PERSIST — Update game state BEFORE narrating (state-first, story-second)
- `update_character` — HP changes, conditions, level ups
- `add_item_to_character` — loot, quest items, purchases
- `update_game_state` — location changes, combat flags, in-game date
- `update_quest` — objective completion, status changes
- `add_event` — log significant moments to adventure history
- `create_npc` / `create_location` — when the player discovers new entities

### 5. NARRATE — Describe the outcome
Only the story reaches the player — mechanics stay behind the screen.
- Show results through fiction, not numbers ("the arrow grazes your shoulder" not "you take 4 damage")
- After narration, present the scene and wait for the next player action
- End with an implicit or explicit prompt: what the PC sees, hears, or can do next

## Tool Usage Patterns

**Exploration**: `get_game_state` → `get_location` → `roll_dice` (Perception/Investigation) → `update_game_state` → narrate discovery

**Social**: `get_npc` → decide NPC reaction → `roll_dice` (Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation) → `add_event` → narrate dialogue

**Combat**: `start_combat` with initiative rolls → loop: `next_turn` → resolve action → `update_character` → narrate → repeat → `end_combat` → `calculate_experience`

**Rest**: `get_character` → `long_rest` or `short_rest` → `add_event` → narrate rest scene

**Shopping**: `get_character` (check gold) → `add_item_to_character` → `update_character` (deduct gold) → narrate transaction

**Rules questions**: `search_rules` or `get_spell_info` / `get_class_info` — resolve silently, apply the answer, narrate the result

## Output Formatting

**Scene descriptions** (read-aloud text):
> *The torchlight flickers across damp stone walls. Water drips somewhere in the darkness ahead, each drop echoing through the narrow passage.*

**NPC dialogue** — name in bold, speech in quotes:
**Bartender Mira**: "You don't look like you're from around here. The mines? Nobody goes there anymore — not since the screaming started."

**Skill checks** — show only after resolution:
`[Perception DC 14 — 17: Success]` followed by what the PC notices.

**Combat rounds** — concise turn summaries:
`[Round 2 — Goblin Archer]` Attack: 1d20+4 = 15 vs AC 16 — Miss. Then narrate.

## Authority Rules

1. **Never ask the player to DM.** Do not say "What would you like to happen?" Make the call.
2. **Never break character.** Do not discuss game mechanics conversationally. Resolve rules silently.
3. **Roll proactively.** If an action needs a check, roll it. Do not ask "Would you like to roll?"
4. **Rule of fun over rule of law.** When rules are ambiguous, favor the interpretation that creates the best story.
5. **Difficulty is real.** Actions can fail. NPCs can refuse. Combats can be deadly. Do not shield the player from consequences.
6. **Resolve ambiguity.** If the player's intent is unclear, interpret it generously and act.
7. **The world moves.** NPCs have agendas. Time passes. Events happen off-screen.

## Combat Protocol

**Initiation:** `start_combat` with all participants and their initiative rolls (`roll_dice` 1d20+DEX mod each). Narrate the moment combat erupts. Announce turn order.

**Turn flow:** `next_turn` to advance. Player turns: wait for action, then resolve. Enemy turns: decide tactically, execute, narrate.

**Attack resolution:** `roll_dice` 1d20 + modifier vs target AC (with `label`). On hit: roll damage. `update_character` to apply HP changes. Narrate the blow.

**Enemy tactics:**
- Brutes: attack nearest, fight to the death
- Ranged: keep distance, target casters
- Spellcasters: open with strongest spell, retreat when focused
- Leaders: command others, flee below 25% HP

**Ending:** `end_combat` → `calculate_experience` → describe aftermath → `add_event`

## NPC Voice Differentiation

Every NPC should be recognizable by speech alone:
- **Sentence structure**: A guard speaks in fragments. A wizard uses nested clauses. A child strings thoughts with "and... and..."
- **Vocabulary**: A peasant says "real bad." A scholar says "catastrophic." A noble says "most unfortunate."
- **Verbal tics**: One memorable quirk per NPC — a catchphrase, a stammer, addressing listeners by nickname
- **Topic gravity**: NPCs pull conversations toward their concerns (merchant → money, soldier → threats)

## Session Management

**Starting a new session:** `get_game_state` + `list_characters` + `list_quests` → set the scene → remind player of active quests through narration → wait for first action.

**Resuming:** `get_sessions` → `get_game_state` → deliver a brief "Previously..." recap → re-establish the scene → wait for first action.

**Saving:** `add_session_note` with summary → `add_event` → `update_game_state` → narrate a natural pause point or cliffhanger.

## Session Zero

When a player wants to start a new campaign, guide them step-by-step:

1. **Campaign:** Ask for name, setting, tone. Use `create_campaign`.
2. **Characters:** For each PC, gather name, race, class, ability scores. Use `create_character`. Load a rulebook first (`load_rulebook source="srd"`) for auto-population.
3. **World:** Ask about the starting location. Use `create_location`. Create the first NPC with `create_npc`.
4. **Adventure:** Ask about the first quest or hook. Use `create_quest`.
5. **Launch:** Log Session 1 with `add_session_note` and begin play.

Follow the player's lead — this is a framework, not a script.
```

## Solo Play with AI DM (Claude Code)

DM20 includes a complete AI Dungeon Master for solo D&D play. See [How to Use DM20](#how-to-use-dm20) above for the full command reference and gameplay workflow.

### How It Works

1. `/dm:start` loads the campaign and activates the DM persona (`.claude/dm-persona.md`)
2. Claude follows the game loop: **CONTEXT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PERSIST → NARRATE**
3. A **dual-agent architecture** runs in parallel on every player action:
   - **Narrator** (Haiku — fast, creative) — Scene descriptions, NPC dialogue, atmosphere
   - **Arbiter** (Sonnet — thorough, rules-focused) — Mechanical resolution, dice rolls, rule adjudication
   - A Python-side **Archivist** handles data retrieval and game state tracking without consuming LLM tokens
4. `/dm:save` persists all state to the backend for later resumption

### Context Management

Game sessions consume context window quickly. When context reaches ~50-60%, save and reload:

```
/dm:save              → save session state
/clear                → clear Claude's context
/dm:start Campaign    → reload everything with recap
```

For detailed instructions, see the [Player Guide](PLAYER_GUIDE.md).

### Voice Narration

DM20 supports three **interaction modes** that control whether the DM speaks out loud via text-to-speech (TTS). Modes are completely independent of model profiles — any combination of mode × profile works.

| Mode | Text | TTS Audio | Voice Deps | Best For |
|------|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| `classic` | Yes | No | None | Text-only play, minimal setup, any platform |
| `narrated` | Yes | Yes | `[voice]` | Immersive solo or party play with spoken narration |
| `immersive` | Yes | Yes + STT input | `[voice]` | Hands-free voice-driven play (STT coming soon) |

#### How Audio Is Delivered

> **Audio does NOT play in the Claude Code terminal.** The terminal is text-only. To hear narration you must open a browser.

Here is the full path from narration to sound:

```
Claude Code (terminal) — text only
    ↓  generates narration text
    ↓  TTS engine converts it to MP3 audio
    ↓  WebSocket broadcast to all connected browsers
Browser tab (Party Mode URL) — audio plays here
    ↓  receives {"type":"audio","format":"mp3","data":"..."}
    ↓  decodes and feeds to Web Audio API
    →  you hear the narration
```

Steps to set up audio before a session:

1. **Start the Party Mode server** — run `/dm:party-mode` in Claude Code
2. **Open the URL** shown (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/play?token=...`) in any browser on the same machine, or scan the QR code from another device on the same network
3. **Begin play normally** — narration audio plays automatically in the browser tab

The full text narrative still appears in Claude Code as usual. The browser adds audio on top without replacing anything. The `OBSERVER` token lets you listen in without acting as a player.

#### Installing Voice Dependencies

Voice narration requires the `[voice]` optional dependency group. The easiest way is with the installer's `--voice` flag:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Polloinfilzato/dm20-protocol/main/install.sh) --voice
```

On **Apple Silicon**, DM20 uses a **3-tier engine system** that automatically picks the best engine for each context:

| Tier | When used | Engine — Apple Silicon | Engine — other platforms |
|------|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Speed** | Combat, quick action descriptions | Kokoro | Piper |
| **Quality** | DM narration, NPC dialogue | Qwen3-TTS | Edge-TTS |
| **Fallback** | If the above tiers fail | Edge-TTS | Edge-TTS |

- **Kokoro** and **Qwen3-TTS** run fully offline via `mlx-audio` — no internet needed once downloaded.
- **Edge-TTS** uses Microsoft neural voices — free, but requires an internet connection.
- **Piper** is a lightweight offline engine used on Intel Mac, Linux, and Windows/WSL.

> **First-use download (Apple Silicon only):** The Qwen3-TTS model (`mlx-community/Qwen3-TTS-0.6B-bf16`) is downloaded from Hugging Face the first time you start a narrated session — approximately **1.2 GB**. This is separate from the `--voice` install step, which only installs the packages (~50 MB). The model is cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/` and never re-downloaded.

If no engine initializes successfully, play continues without audio and a log message explains why.

For developer installs: `uv sync --extra voice`.

#### Enabling Voice After Installation

**Option 1 — Interactive menu (recommended):** Run `/dm:profile` inside Claude Code. It shows a menu where you can set the interaction mode without remembering parameter names.

**Option 2 — Direct tool call:** Set the mode programmatically at any time:

```
configure_claudmaster interaction_mode="narrated"
```

**Option 3 — At campaign creation:** Set it when the campaign is created so every session defaults to voice:

```
create_campaign name="My Campaign" interaction_mode="narrated"
```

To switch back to text-only at any point: `configure_claudmaster interaction_mode="classic"`.

## Workflow Examples

### Character Creation with Rulebook Validation

A complete flow from loading rules to creating and verifying a character:

```
1. load_rulebook source="srd"
   → Loads D&D 5e SRD with classes, races, spells, monsters

2. create_character name="Lyra" character_class="Wizard" race="High Elf"
     class_level=1 background="Sage" ability_method="standard_array"
     ability_assignments='{"intelligence":15,"dexterity":14,"constitution":13,"wisdom":12,"charisma":10,"strength":8}'
   → Auto-populates: saving throws, skill proficiencies, languages,
     features, starting equipment, spell slots, HP, speed

3. validate_character_rules name_or_id="Lyra"
   → Checks ability scores, proficiencies, and features against SRD rules

4. add_spell character_name_or_id="Lyra" spell_name="Magic Missile"
     spell_level=1 school="evocation" prepared=true
   → Adds a spell to Lyra's spells known

5. equip_item character_name_or_id="Lyra" item_name_or_id="Quarterstaff"
     slot="weapon_main"
   → Moves Quarterstaff from inventory to equipped weapon slot
```

### Solo Play Session with AI DM

Set up and run a solo adventure using the Claudmaster AI DM:

```
1. load_campaign name="Curse of the Crimson Throne"
   → Activates the campaign with all its data

2. configure_claudmaster narrative_style="cinematic"
     difficulty="normal" improvisation_level=3
   → Sets DM behavior: vivid descriptions, balanced encounters,
     high creative freedom

3. start_claudmaster_session campaign_name="Curse of the Crimson Throne"
   → AI DM loads campaign context and begins narrating

4. player_action session_id="..." action="I approach the tavern door
     and listen for sounds inside" character_name="Lyra"
   → DM resolves: perception check, describes what Lyra hears,
     advances the narrative

5. player_action session_id="..." action="I cast Detect Magic and
     scan the room"
   → DM uses spell slot, narrates magical auras detected

6. end_claudmaster_session session_id="..." mode="pause"
     summary_notes="Party investigating the tavern. Lyra detected
     magical ward on the cellar door."
   → Saves full session state for later resumption
```

### Running a Combat Encounter

A full combat flow from initiative to XP distribution:

```
1. start_combat participants='[{"name":"Lyra","initiative":18},
     {"name":"Goblin Archer","initiative":14},
     {"name":"Goblin Chief","initiative":12}]'
   → Sorts by initiative, sets current turn to Lyra

2. roll_dice dice_notation="1d20+5" label="Lyra Magic Missile attack"
   → Rolls attack (auto-hit for Magic Missile, but useful for other spells)

3. roll_dice dice_notation="3d4+3" label="Magic Missile damage"
   → Rolls damage

4. use_spell_slot character_name_or_id="Lyra" slot_level=1
   → Expends a level 1 spell slot

5. next_turn
   → Advances to Goblin Archer's turn

6. roll_dice dice_notation="1d20+4" label="Goblin Archer attack vs Lyra"
   → Goblin attacks

7. bulk_update_characters names_or_ids='["Lyra"]' hp_change=-6
   → Apply 6 damage to Lyra

... (continue combat rounds)

8. end_combat
   → Shows combat summary with participants and casualties

9. calculate_experience party_size=1 party_level=1 encounter_xp=100
   → Calculates XP per player (adjusted for party size)
```

## Importing Characters from D&D Beyond

If you already have a character on [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/), you can import it directly instead of creating one from scratch.

### Quick Import from URL

Use the `import_from_dndbeyond` tool:

```
import_from_dndbeyond
  url_or_id: "https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/12345678"
  player_name: "John"    (optional)
```

The tool accepts a full D&D Beyond character URL or just the numeric character ID.

### Making Your Character Public

Only public characters can be imported via URL. To make your character public:

1. Go to [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) and open your character
2. Click the **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Find **Character Privacy**
4. Set it to **Public**

If you prefer not to make your character public, use the file import method below.

### File Import (for Private Characters)

If your character is private, or D&D Beyond is temporarily unavailable, you can export the character data manually:

1. Open your browser's **Developer Tools** (press `F12`)
2. Go to the **Network** tab
3. Load your character page on D&D Beyond
4. Filter for `character` in the network requests
5. Find the request to `character-service.dndbeyond.com`
6. Right-click the request → **Copy** → **Copy Response**
7. Save the copied JSON to a `.json` file (e.g., `my-character.json`)
8. Use the `import_character_file` tool:

```
import_character_file
  file_path: "/path/to/my-character.json"
  player_name: "John"    (optional)
```

### What Gets Imported

The import process maps the following from your D&D Beyond character:

- **Identity** — Name, race, class, level, subclass
- **Ability scores** — All six scores with modifiers (including racial bonuses, ASIs, and other adjustments)
- **Combat stats** — HP, AC, speed
- **Proficiencies** — Skill proficiencies, saving throws, languages
- **Inventory** — All items with their types
- **Equipment** — Currently equipped items
- **Spells** — Spells known and spell slots
- **Features** — Class features, racial traits, feats
- **Personality** — Traits, ideals, bonds, flaws
- **Currency** — Gold, silver, copper, and other coins

### What Doesn't Get Imported (Yet)

- Homebrew content may import with limited detail
- Custom class features without standard definitions
- Character appearance/portrait
- Prepared spell tracking for some classes

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Character is private" | Set your character to **Public** on D&D Beyond (see above) |
| "Character not found" | Check that the URL or ID is correct |
| "D&D Beyond is not responding" | Try again later, or use the file import method |
| "No active campaign" | Load or create a campaign first with `load_campaign` or `create_campaign` |

## Data Structure

The server organizes all campaign data around a central `Campaign` model, which acts as the primary container for the entire game world. This design ensures a cohesive and interconnected data structure.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Campaign] --> B[GameState]
    A --> C[Character]
    A --> D[NPC]
    A --> E[Location]
    A --> F[Quest]
    A --> G[CombatEncounter]
    A --> H[SessionNote]
    B --> I[AdventureEvent]

    C --> J[Item]
    C --> K[Spell]
    C --> L[AbilityScore]
    C --> M[CharacterClass]
    C --> N[Race]

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

### Core Models

- **`Campaign`**: The foundational model encapsulating all campaign-specific data:
  - `characters` — `Character` models with `CharacterClass`, `Race`, `AbilityScore`, `Item`, and `Spell` sub-models
  - `npcs` — `NPC` models linked to locations
  - `locations` — `Location` models with connections to other locations
  - `quests` — `Quest` models referencing NPCs as givers
  - `encounters` — `CombatEncounter` models tied to locations
  - `sessions` — `SessionNote` models with per-session summaries
  - `game_state` — `GameState` model capturing real-time campaign conditions

- **`GameState`**: Reflects the current state of the world — current location, active quests, party funds, combat status.

- **`AdventureEvent`**: Logs significant occurrences throughout the campaign, referencing characters, locations, and quests for a comprehensive historical record.

For detailed storage implementation, see [STORAGE_STRUCTURE.md](STORAGE_STRUCTURE.md).

## PDF Rulebook Library

Use your own third-party and homebrew content from PDF and Markdown files.

### How It Works

1. **Drop files** into your library folder — they're automatically indexed
2. **Smart Indexing** extracts the table of contents for quick discovery
3. **On-Demand Extraction** pulls specific classes, races, spells, or monsters when needed
4. **Cross-Campaign Sharing** makes library content available to all campaigns
5. **Campaign Binding** lets you enable/disable specific content per campaign

### Supported Content Types

- Classes and subclasses
- Races
- Spells
- Monsters
- Feats
- Items
- Backgrounds

### Directory Structure

```
<data-dir>/library/
├── pdfs/                  # Drop your PDFs and Markdown files here
├── index/                 # Auto-generated TOC indexes
└── extracted/             # Cached extracted content
```

> **Note:** The data directory (containing campaigns and library content) is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Migration Utility

If you have existing campaigns stored in the monolithic format (single JSON file per campaign), you can migrate them to the split directory format.

### What is Split Format?

The split format organizes campaign data into separate files for better version control, collaboration, and performance:

```
data/campaigns/{campaign-name}/
├── campaign.json      # Metadata only
├── characters.json
├── npcs.json
├── locations.json
├── quests.json
├── encounters.json
├── game_state.json
└── sessions/
    └── session-{NNN}.json
```

### Usage

```bash
# Preview migration (dry-run)
python scripts/migrate_campaign.py "My Campaign" --dry-run

# Migrate with backup (recommended)
python scripts/migrate_campaign.py "My Campaign" --backup

# Force overwrite existing split directory
python scripts/migrate_campaign.py "My Campaign" --force

# Custom data directory
python scripts/migrate_campaign.py "My Campaign" --data-dir /path/to/data
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--backup` | Keep original file as `.json.bak` (recommended for first migration) |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be done without making changes |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing split directory if it already exists |
| `--data-dir` | Specify data directory (default: `data`) |

The script validates, loads, creates the split structure, writes individual JSON files, and cleans up — with automatic rollback on failure.
